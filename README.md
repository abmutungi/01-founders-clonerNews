### [Hacker News API](https://news.ycombinator.com/) Project

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

The objective is to code a UI for the [HackerNews API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). It handles:

- Posts: including:
  - stories
  - jobs
  - polls
- comments: each comment must have the proper post parent.

This project introduced me to :

- API
- Throttling/debouncing
